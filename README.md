# who-is-dugoo
Sopel module to bother people who call me by a silly nickname

## Requirements
who-is-dugoo relies only on the Python standard library.

## Usage
No commands. Really, I don't expect this to be particularly useful to anyone
else, except as a starting point for a similar module to handle their own
annoying channel users.
